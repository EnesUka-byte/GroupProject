    <strong>Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West</strong> (known simply and more commonly as
    <em>Blood Meridian</em>) is a 1985 epic historical novel by American author Cormac McCarthy,
    classified as an anti-Western and Gothic Western. McCarthy's fifth book, it was published by
    Random House.
  </p>
  <p>
    Set in the American frontier with a loose historical context, the narrative follows a fictional
    teenager from Tennessee referred to as "the kid", with the bulk of the text devoted to his
    experiences with the Glanton gang, a historical group of scalp hunters who massacred American
    Indians and others in the United Statesâ€“Mexico borderlands from 1849 to 1850 for bounty, sadistic
    pleasure, and eventually out of nihilistic habit. The role of antagonist is gradually filled by
    Judge Holden, a physically massive, highly educated, preternaturally skilled member of the gang
    with pale and hairless skin who relishes the destruction and domination of whatever he encounters,
    including children and docile animals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the novel initially received lukewarm critical and commercial reception, it has since
    become highly acclaimed and is widely recognized as McCarthy's magnum opus and one of the greatest
    American novels of all time, with some labelling the work as the Great American Novel.
