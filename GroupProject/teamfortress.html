  <h3>Theme: Team Fortress 2</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Team Fortress 2 (TF2)</strong> is a multiplayer first-person shooter game developed and published by
    <strong>Valve Corporation</strong> in 2007. It is the sequel to the 1996 <em>Team Fortress</em> mod for
    <em>Quake</em> and its 1999 remake, <em>Team Fortress Classic</em>. It was released in October 2007 as part of
    <em>The Orange Box</em> for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360, and was ported to the PlayStation 3 in December
    2007. It was released as a standalone game for Windows in April 2008, and later updated to support macOS in June
    2010 and Linux in February 2013. It became free-to-play in June 2011 and is distributed through Valve’s
    <strong>Steam</strong> platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    Players join one of two teams — <strong>RED</strong> or <strong>BLU</strong> — and choose from nine unique
    character classes to compete in game modes such as <em>capture the flag</em> and <em>king of the hill</em>. Its
    development was led by <strong>John Cook</strong> and <strong>Robin Walker</strong>, the developers of the original
    mod. Announced in 1998 as <em>Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms</em>, the project initially aimed for realistic,
    militaristic visuals and gameplay. Over nine years of development, it transformed into a colorful, stylized
    experience. When Valve went silent for six years, TF2 frequently appeared on Wired News’s annual “vaporware” list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally released in 2007 using Valve’s <strong>Source Engine</strong>, <em>Team Fortress 2</em> preserved the
    series’ class-based gameplay while introducing a bold, cartoonish art direction inspired by the works of
    <strong>J. C. Leyendecker</strong>, <strong>Dean Cornwell</strong>, and <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong>. The
    result was a distinctive 1960s spy film aesthetic and a strong focus on personality and humor for each playable
    class. <em>Team Fortress 2</em> has received critical acclaim for its art style, gameplay, humor, and use of character in a
    wholly multiplayer game. Since its release, it has been celebrated as one of the greatest video games ever made,
    maintaining a passionate online community with fan animations, comics, and Valve’s annual <strong>Saxxy
    Awards</strong> film contest. It also stands as a key forerunner to the modern <strong>hero shooter</strong> genre,
    pioneering many of its core design principles.
