    <strong>Cry of Fear</strong> is a 2012 indie survival horror video game developed and published by
    <strong>Team Psykskallar</strong>. It originated as a mod for <em>Half-Life</em> developed by the same team a year
    earlier. The game follows the story of <strong>Simon Henriksson</strong>, a 19-year-old Swedish man suffering from
    depression and anxiety as he explores the eerie streets of Stockholm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Combining elements of survival horror and first-person shooter gameplay, <em>Cry of Fear</em> challenges players to
    navigate through a haunting urban landscape filled with monsters and unsettling psychological imagery. Its story
    delves into themes of <strong>mental illness</strong> and <strong>trauma</strong>, earning praise for its
    atmospheric tension, narrative depth, and creative use of the <em>Half-Life</em> engine. The game received multiple
    accolades, including the <strong>Mod DB</strong> awards for <em>Best Single Player Game of the Year</em> and the
    <em>Community Award</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Gameplay</strong><br><br>
    In <em>Cry of Fear</em>, players control Simon Henriksson, who awakens in a dark alley in Stockholm shortly after
    being struck by a car. From a first-person perspective, players must solve puzzles, explore eerie environments, and
    fight disturbing creatures to survive. The game alternates between the real world and nightmarish dreamscapes,
    reminiscent of the <em>Silent Hill</em> series.  Depending on the playerâ€™s choices, there are multiple endings and numerous unlockables. Tape recorders serve as save
    points, adding a layer of tension to each encounter. The blend of psychological storytelling, exploration, and
    combat makes <em>Cry of Fear</em> a standout example of atmospheric indie horror design.
